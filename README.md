# bf
is a tiny brainf\*\*k interpreter.

## Installation
You should have a C compiler, preferably GCC or clang. Once you have that, do the following:

```sh
$ git clone http://github.com/AjayMT/bf.git
$ cd bf
$ make install
```

That puts the `bf` executable in `/usr/local/bin`.

## Usage

```
bf <program>
```

Where `<program>` is a path to a brainf\*\*k program.

## About
This was just a little experiment with C and brainf\*\*k. I'm pretty sure this isn't the fastest or smallest brainf\*\*k interpreter around, but it's pretty darn fast and pretty darn small.
